    <p>Succulents are one of my favorite plants because they are related to cacti. Succulents are low maintences and require very little water. However, sunshine is much needed. </p>

    <p>If you find your succulent not looking healthy anymore, you can certainly pick off one of the petals and start putting them in separate soil through the process of propagation.</p>
